=About YouTube Sniffer=

This project was started around March, 2012. Some of the version of AG YouTube Video Grabber is released to public for non-commercial purpose. 

That time, I don’t think about to create a Google Code page for this project, until about September, 2012, this page was created by the main developer of AG YouTube Video Grabber - GaryNg. Some of the update history of AG YouTube Video Grabber is unrecorded so I can't list them. Sorry for that :(
