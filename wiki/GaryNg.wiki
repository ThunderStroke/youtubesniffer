Born in 1998. My first learnt language was Batch scripting, this make me knew more about how Windows operate and what Windows can do without using the GUI.

At December,2012, I learnt VB6. I don't choose VB.net because of its huge .net framework, I like "green" (or portable) program, although VB6 was almost out-of-date.

Until now, VB6 is still my main developing tools, and I learnt few famous programming language such as C, and learnt AutoIt3 for fun.

At November 2012, I changed my mind, I decided to learn C# as I found VB6 can't do many things. Then I rewrote Grabber in C# in a few weeks.

I had my own blog: [http://garyngzhongb.blogspot.com Gary's Zone] _The blog is in Chinese!_
and my software download zone that I built with Dropbox: [http://garyzone.tk Gary's Software Download Zone]
