==Introduction==

This tutorial is slightly different from [http://code.google.com/p/youtubesniffer/wiki/Tut1UsingNetworkSniffer tutorial 1] and [http://code.google.com/p/youtubesniffer/wiki/Tut2ByGenerate204 tutorial 2], in the previous tutorial, I use the tool that built-in in Google Chrome, in this tutorial, we try a different way!


YouTube provide a php file *get_video_info* to get a video's information, what we have to do is just set the parameter *video_id* and navigate to that link, the browser will download that file and we can open that downloaded file with Notepad (or Notepad++), all the information we want was in there!

By the way, I suggest not to use this methods because it cannot get all video's information and video download link, this tutorial written for your extraformation.
------
==Start==
First, you need a video (I will use my video [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6K0cfBcK6nM Download The YouTube Video Without Any Program] as demonstration), copy the string after the parameter *v=*, for example the video http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6K0cfBcK6nM, the string after the parameter is *6K0cfBcK6nM*

Then replace the *xxxx* in *http://youtube.com/get_video_info?video_id=xxxx* to the video's ID!

Still remember the tools I provide? -- [http://dl.dropbox.com/u/43619472/OtherSoft/YouTubeSniffer_src_bin.zip YouTube Sniffer Tools], if you can't get the video id correct, you can use it! Download and open the program, paste the video link in the textbox beside the label "YouTube Video Link:", then press *Enter*.

The video's ID is there! The get_video_info link, too!

So, the get_video_info link for my video is:http://youtube.com/get_video_info?video_id=6K0cfBcK6nM, open up your browser and navigate to that link, your internet browser will pop up to download the file, download it. After downloaded, open the file with Notepad.
